IndoMod – Value Chains is an adaption of the original IndoMod land use model, developed as part of the Agricultural Policy Research to Support Natural Resource Management in Indonesia’s Upland Landscapes project, funded by the Australian Centre for International Agricultural Research (ACIAR project ADP/2015/043). 

IndoMod – Value Chains is an agent-based simulation model for smallholder value chain interventions for the peri urban uplands of Bandung, Indonesia. The IndoMod Value Chains model simulates smallholder land use decisions for the peri-urban uplands of Bandung, Indonesia given the introduction of value chain designs. The aim of the model is to help the user understand land use changes, and subsequent erosion, carbon biomass, and smallholder income changes under different value chain designs. 

In the model it is possible to test value chain interventions for the four major land uses in the Bandung uplands - Coffee, Horticulture, Rice, and Mixed Agroforestry. While not the primary focus of the model, it is also possible to test non-value chain scenarios. This user manual describes the model and provides instructions on how to model different value chain and non-value chain scenarios.

IndoMod was developed using discounted input and output flows for different land uses, of which an excel based model has also been developed called KopiMod. Access and details of this model can be found here https://sites.google.com/view/danielhill/projects/kopimod.
